#Basic MATLAB coding tute: code organization

Provides examples of good and bad practices

We will cover the following:

1. Adding your functions to the MATLAB path. (pathtool, addpath, rmpath)
2. Getting help. (help and doc, lookfor and the H1 line, the newsgroup, the file exchange).
3. Writing good help and documentation for your functions.
4. Variable scope: the MATLAB workspace. Scripts vs functions. Local variables, global variables, evalin.
5. How to choose what input arguments to use in your functions.
