#This is a shell script that starts MATLAB. It works on Max and Linux. Should also work on Windows in a modified form

#First it adds my main MATLAB code directory to the MATLAB path using a system variable
export MATLABPATH=/Users/raacampbell/work/Matlab_Scripts/

#Now it starts MATLAB without the GUI (just because I prefer that)
/Applications/MATLAB_R2014a.app/bin/matlab -nodesktop -nosplash

#Once MATLAB is started, it runs the startup.m file that is located in the code directory
